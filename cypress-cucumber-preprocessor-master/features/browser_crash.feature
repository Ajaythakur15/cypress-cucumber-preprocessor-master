Feature: browser crash

  # Crash-behavior is a mess, ref. https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22631.
  # Pre-12.17.0, enabling video recording actually made a difference, ref. https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/27167.
  # Post-12.17.0 behavior seems to be consistent enough that it's testable.
