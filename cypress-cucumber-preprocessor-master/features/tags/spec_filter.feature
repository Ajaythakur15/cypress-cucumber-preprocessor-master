  Rule: it should filter features based on whether they contain a matching scenario

    Scenario: 1 / 2 specs matching
      When I run cypress with "--env tags=@foo"
      Then it passes
      And it should appear to not have ran spec "bar.feature"
      But it should appear to have ran spec "foo.feature"

    Scenario: 2 / 2 specs matching
      When I run cypress with "--env tags=\"@foo or @bar\""
      Then it passes
      And it should appear to have ran spec "foo.feature" and "bar.feature"

  Rule: filterSpecsMixedMode: hide (default) should hide non-feature specs regardless of tag expression

    Scenario: positive tag expression
      When I run cypress with "--env tags=@foo"
      Then it passes
      And it should appear to not have ran spec "baz.spec.js"

    Scenario: negative tag expression
      When I run cypress with "--env \"tags=not @foo\""
      Then it passes
      And it should appear to not have ran spec "baz.spec.js"

  Rule: filterSpecsMixedMode: show should show non-feature specs regardless of tag expression

  Rule: filterSpecsMixedMode: empty-set should filter non-feature specs as if they have tags equalling the empty set
