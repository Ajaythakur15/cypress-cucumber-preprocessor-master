# Pretty output

Pretty output is an alternative Cypress reporter which will print steps as they are executed, like shown below.

</p>

Pretty output can be turned on like shown below.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    reporter: require.resolve("@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/pretty-reporter")
  },
});
```

If you do not have access to `require.resolve`, such as when configuring reporter from the command line, you can use the following path instead.

```
$ cypress run --reporter @badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/dist/subpath-entrypoints/pretty-reporter.js
```

The reason for having to use `require.resolve` or a needlessly cumbersome path, is because a) this package's use of [Conditional Exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports) and b) Cypress circumventing the built-in resolve mechanism in Node when loading reporters. This disables the use of [PnP](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18922), among other things, including making this a bit more difficult than it has to be.

> :pushpin: Combine pretty output with Cypress' own `-q / --quiet` option to obtain particularly terse output as seen in the animation above.

## Usage with `cypress-multi-reporters`

If you want to use pretty output with `cypress-multi-reporters`, presumably because you are using multiple reporters, then you **also** need to explicitly turn on the `pretty.enabled` property. The preprocessor uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig), which means you can place configuration options in EG. `.cypress-cucumber-preprocessorrc.json` or `package.json`. An example configuration is shown below.

The reason for having to do this explicitly when using `cypress-multi-reporters`, is explained further below.

```
{
  "pretty": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

### Explanation

This sections requires some technical introduction. The library assumes a couple of different roles and has code running in four primary places:

* As an esbuild plugin / vite plugin / webpack loader / browserify transform
* In the browser
* Within `setupNodeEvents() { .. }`
* As a reporter

A reporter doesn't have much knowledge about the tests or which steps they may consist of. Reporters are limited to the domain and events exhibited by [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), which is unaware of Cucumber. Thus, most of the pretty output doesn't actually originate from the reporter.

Instead, use of `@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/pretty-reporter` is detected by the part which runs within `setupNodeEvents() { .. }` and it's this code which is responsible for most of the pretty output.

This code however is unable to detect your intention of using pretty output if it's configured through `cypress-multi-reporters`. In the absence of being able to detect this, you can manually instruct the preprocessor to turn on pretty output by explicitly turning on `pretty.enabled`.
