# Step definitions

Step definitions are resolved using search paths that are configurable through the `stepDefinitions` property. The preprocessor uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig), which means you can place configuration options in EG. `.cypress-cucumber-preprocessorrc.json` or `package.json`. The default search paths are shown below.

```json
{
  "stepDefinitions": [
    "cypress/e2e/[filepath]/**/*.{js,ts}",
    "cypress/e2e/[filepath].{js,ts}",
    "cypress/support/step_definitions/**/*.{js,ts}",
  ]
}
```

The default configuration means that if you have a file `cypress/e2e/duckduckgo.feature`, it will match step definitions found in

* `cypress/e2e/duckduckgo/steps.ts`
* `cypress/e2e/duckduckgo.ts`
* `cypress/support/step_definitions/duckduckgo.ts`

## Pairing explained

From Cucumber you might be familiar with the fact that step definitons *aren't* linked to particular feature files, as per their [docs](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/step-definitions):

> Step definitions aren’t linked to a particular feature file or scenario. The file, class or package name of a step definition does not affect what Gherkin steps it will match. The only thing that matters is the step definition’s expression.

This is *not* true for the preprocessor and represents the only place where the two experiences (Cucumber vs. Cypress + this preprocessor) deviates significantly. However, the preprocessor don't magically understand your intention in regards to this.

**Pairing** dictates which step definitions will be available in which feature files. Furthermore, hooks specified in paired files are the hooks which will take effect. Pairing is entirely configured through the `stepDefinitions` property. Below are some examples to further explain this concept.

A prerequisite for understanding this process is some knowledge of glob / search patterns. Explaining this however is out of the scope is this page. Internally, [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) is used.

### Example 1: Templating introduced

Let's consider the following directory structure.

```
/home/john.doe/my-project
└── cypress
    └── e2e
        ├── foo
        │   ├── a.feature
        │   └── a.js
        └── bar
            ├── b.feature
            └── b.js
```

.. and a configuration `{ "stepDefinitions": ["cypress/e2e/[filepath].js"] }`. The following is what happens when you run `a.feature`:

1. The project root (`"/home/john.doe/my-project"`) is subtracted from the full path of the feature file, leaving us with with `"cypress/e2e/foo/a.feature"`.
2. The *integration directory* (`"cypress/e2e"`) is subtracted from above result, resulting in `"foo/a.feature"`.
   - For Cypress v9 users and below, the *integration directory* is an explicitly configured path.
   - For Cypress v10 users and higher, this is implicitly calculated and is the *common ancestor path* of all feature files found. For the example above, this is `"cypress/e2e"`. Thus we're left with `"foo/a.feature"`.
3. The file extension is removed, leaving us with `"foo/a"`.

The last value is used to replace `[filepath]` in each member of the configured `stepDefinitions`. For our example above this would yield `["cypress/e2e/foo/a.js"]`. This resulting array is used as search patterns for files containing step definitions (internally using [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob)).

When `a.feature` is run, the preprocessor will only looks for step definitions in `cypress/e2e/foo/a.js`. Furthermore, only hooks defined in said file will take effect. The feature file is now said to be *paired* with that file containing step definitions.

The observant reader will now understand that the `[filepath]` template value allows you to create a hierarchy of step definitions that matches the structure of your feature files. It also allows to you put step definitions in an entirely separate directory.

### Example 2: Directory with common step definitions

Let's now consider the following directory structure.

```
/home/john.doe/my-project
└── cypress
    └── e2e
        ├── foo
        │   ├── a.feature
        │   └── a.js
        ├── bar
        │   ├── b.feature
        │   └── b.js
        └── common-step-definitions
            ├── 1.js
            └── 2.js
```

Using the *same* value `stepDefinitions` as before, the preprocessor would *not* be able to resolve any files in `cypress/e2e/common-step-definitions`. This is likely not what you want, but we can add a member to the configuration value, as shown below.

```
{
  "stepDefinitions": [
    "cypress/e2e/[filepath].js",
    "cypress/e2e/common-step-definitions/*.js"
  ]
}
```

When running `a.feature`, we know from the previous example that the first member of the array would yield the search pattern `cypress/e2e/foo/a.js`, which correctly matches one of our files.

The least member however, obeys to the same rules and goes to the same string replacement process described previously. It doesn't contain `[filepath]`, but that doesn't matter. The resulting search pattern is `"cypress/e2e/common-step-definitions/*.js"`, which is provided to [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) and would yield `1.js` and `2.js`.

All of these three files are now said to be *paired* with `a.feature`. Hooks in `b.js` will not be available when running `a.feature` and its hooks will not take effect.

### Example 3: A common mistake

Now let's consider the *same* file & directory structure as in the previous example, but the following configuration.

```
{
  "stepDefinitions": [
    "cypress/e2e/**/*.js"
  ]
}
```

The single value will go through the string replacement process and yield itself, because it does not contain the string `[filepath]`. The value will then be propagated to [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob), which will find *every* `.js` file in the hierarchy.

You might initially be tempted to believe that you have configured the processor correctly, because your test might run at this point. However, step definitions from `b.js` will be available in `a.feature` and vice versa. Similarly, hooks in either file will always take effect.

### Example 4: Hierarchy

There's also a `[filepart]` option available (notice the subtle difference from `[filepath]`). Given a configuration shown below

```json
{
  "stepDefinitions": [
    "cypress/e2e/[filepart]/step_definitions/**/*.{js,ts}"
  ]
}
```

... and a feature file `cypress/e2e/foo/bar/baz.feature`. When running said feature file, the preprocessor would go through a process and replace `[filepath]` with `"foo/bar/baz"` in each member of the configuration (here a single value).

The `[filepart]` options works similarly, except that the previous mentioned value (`"foo/bar/baz"`) is further split into

- `"foo/bar/baz"`
- `"foo/bar"`
- `"foo"`
- `"."`

All of these will be used to replace `[filepart]`. Thus, a single configuration member would yield *four* values and use [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) to search in

* `"cypress/e2e/foo/bar/baz/step_definitions/**/*.{js,ts}"`
* `"cypress/e2e/foo/bar/step_definitions/**/*.{js,ts}"`
* `"cypress/e2e/foo/step_definitions/**/*.{js,ts}"`
* `"cypress/e2e/step_definitions/**/*.{js,ts}"`

## Caveats

The library makes use of [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) to turn patterns into a list of files. This has some implications, explained below (list is non-exhaustive and will be expanded on demand).

* Single term inside braces, EG. `foo/bar.{js}`, doesn't work as you might expect, ref. https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/434.
