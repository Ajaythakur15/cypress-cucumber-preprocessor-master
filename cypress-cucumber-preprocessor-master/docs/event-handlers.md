# :warning: On event handlers

This plugin will register multiple types of life-cycle event handlers. However, only a single event handler can exist for each type of event (due to a limitation in Cypress). Thus, if you attempt to define any of the same handlers, your handler will either be overriden by this plugin or you will override this plugin's handler. Either way, the behavior will be surprising.

There's an (multiple actually) open [issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22428) at Cypress tracking this limitation.

These are the event this plugin will subscribe to:

* before:run
* after:run
* before:spec
* after:spec
* after:screenshot

For example, if you specify a handler for `after:screenshot` and override this plugin's handler, then screenshots will no longer be automatically added to JSON reports. This is just one type of issue that can arise by overriding event handlers.

The following plugins (non-exhaustive) are known to also define event handlers.

- [@bahmutov/cypress-code-coverage][@bahmutov/cypress-code-coverage]
- [allure-cypress][allure-cypress]
- [cypress-allure-plugin][cypress-allure-plugin]
- [cypress-cloud][cypress-cloud]
- [cypress-testrail][cypress-testrail]
- [cypress-xray-plugin][cypress-xray-plugin]
- [cypress-split][cypress-split]
- [cypress-mochawesome-reporter][cypress-mochawesome-reporter]

If you use any of these plugins, then you need to consider [cypress-on-fix][cypress-on-fix], otherwise your mileage may vary.

## Workaround (1 / 2)

Since its inception, [cypress-on-fix][cypress-on-fix] has rendered the original workaround (shown below) virtually obsolete. Using cypress-on-fix is now the preferred and recommended method for combining multiple plugins in a Cypress project. Consult its documentation for how to integrate cypress-on-fix into your project.

## Workaround (2 / 2)

You can through options, obtain more fine-grained control over event behavior and invoke your own code alongside this plugin, as shown below. As explained above, [cypress-on-fix][cypress-on-fix] has rendered this method virtually obsolete.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "cypress";
import createBundler from "@bahmutov/cypress-esbuild-preprocessor";
import {
  addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin,
  beforeRunHandler,
  afterRunHandler,
  beforeSpecHandler,
  afterSpecHandler,
  afterScreenshotHandler,
} from "@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";
import { createEsbuildPlugin } from "@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/esbuild";

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    specPattern: "**/*.feature",
    async setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // This is required for the preprocessor to be able to generate JSON reports after each run, and more,
      await addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config, {
        omitBeforeRunHandler: true,
        omitAfterRunHandler: true,
        omitBeforeSpecHandler: true,
        omitAfterSpecHandler: true,
        omitAfterScreenshotHandler: true,
      });

      on("before:run", async (details) => {
        await beforeRunHandler(config);

        // Your own `before:run` code goes here.
      });

      on("after:run", async (results) => {
        await afterRunHandler(config);

        // Your own `after:run` code goes here.
      });

      on("before:spec", async (spec) => {
        await beforeSpecHandler(config, spec);

        // Your own `before:spec` code goes here.
      });

      on("after:spec", async (spec, results) => {
        await afterSpecHandler(config, spec, results);

        // Your own `after:spec` code goes here.
      });

      on("after:screenshot", async (details) => {
        await afterScreenshotHandler(config, details);

        // Your own `after:screenshot` code goes here.
      });

      on(
        "file:preprocessor",
        createBundler({
          plugins: [createEsbuildPlugin(config)],
        })
      );

      // Make sure to return the config object as it might have been modified by the plugin.
      return config;
    },
  },
});
```
